# Auction-mangment-system
Using Java swing and JDBC
Group 19 designed and implemented an auction application that allows logged in users to participate in bidding for items at an auction. 
   
 our  application has the following:
   
    • An interface that displays images of all items of the auction in 4x4 grid.

 	• Once an item is clicked on, allow the logged in user to see the current
  	highest bid, the amount of time left for that bid to end and allow the user to
  	enter his/her own bid.
	
  	• If the user’s bid is higher, display that bid as the current highest bid.

 	• Allow users to opt out of a bid and if anyone does, recalculate and display
 	 the highest bid.

  	• Once the time for that bid session is over, remove it from the list of items
  	available for auction and update the interface with a new item.

  	• Set the lowest bid for each item and reject any bid that is lower than the
  	lowest possible bid.
